Its construction is degenerate in a Euclidean plane because the two sides would either coincide or one or both would have to be curved. A regular digon has both angles equal and both sides equal and is represented by Schl√§fli symbol {2}. It may be constructed on a sphere as a pair of 180 degree arcs connecting antipodal points, when it forms a lune. The digon is the simplest abstract polytope of rank 2. A truncated digon, t{2} is a square, {4}. An alternated digon, h{2} is a monogon, {1}.');
